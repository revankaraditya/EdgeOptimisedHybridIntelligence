# 🚀 EdgeOptimisedHybridIntelligence

**EdgeOptimisedHybridIntelligence** is a lightweight and efficient implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline tailored for edge devices, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson series. This project demonstrates how to bring the power of large language models (LLMs) and contextual retrieval to resource-constrained environments for real-time, on-site troubleshooting and decision-making.

## 🔍 Overview

This project integrates:

- **Fine-tuned LLaMA 3.2 (1B)**: Adapted with a domain-specific conversational dataset to enhance relevance and coherence in industrial troubleshooting scenarios.
- **RAG Pipeline with LangChain**: Combines retrieval of contextual documents with generative capabilities to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Optimized for Edge Devices**: Runs efficiently on NVIDIA Jetson boards (e.g., Nano, Xavier, Orin).
- ✅ **Conversational AI**: Fine-tuned LLaMA 3.2 (1B) model for natural, human-like interactions.
- ✅ **Contextual Understanding**: Uses LangChain to retrieve relevant documents and generate informed responses.
- ✅ **Industrial Use Case Ready**: Designed for environments where immediate, offline troubleshooting is critical.

## 🏭 Industrial Applications

This solution is ideal for:

- **Manufacturing Plants**: On-device AI assistant for machine diagnostics and maintenance.
- **Remote Facilities**: Offline support for troubleshooting without internet dependency.
- **Smart Factories**: Integration with IoT sensors for real-time issue resolution.
